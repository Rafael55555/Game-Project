The project was live for the majority of the month of May in 2021. It started on April 28, 2021 and ended on May 21, 2021.
The original end goal of the project was to have a game where you catch robots and use them to fight other robots, and I planned on having 3 levels. After working on the project for a while I added more details to game states and made it more about platforming.
I would say it’s very close to my original vision and I just didn’t have enough time to code certain features in. It’s different in that I’m using shapes and background images as the style of the game.
I’m happy with what I’ve made in the amount of time I’ve had to make it. I do think my game is a good product considering how much time I had to make it.
I think I worked well in my group of one.
What worked well with the project was with coding and tracking my time, since I didn’t have that many issues with either of them. What didn’t work well was updating the trello board because oftentimes I just didn’t use it.
During the project I didn’t really learn anything new, but I did straighten my understanding on certain things in python like background images and game states.
My next goal is having the enemy caught be able to be summoned to the screen after you press the summon button and that will be the last thing I work on this project.
If I do this again I’m going to put more thought into the level layout by drawing out what I plan for the level before I code it in. Also I might try and use backgrounds for the platforms.
